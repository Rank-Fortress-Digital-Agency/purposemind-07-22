            The internet is a powerful tool for businesses of all sizes. Suppose you’re not taking advantage of Google My Business. In that case, you’re missing out on a valuable opportunity to connect with customers online. GMB lets you create and manage a free business listing on Google that helps people find your company and learn more about what you do. Here are just a few of the benefits that small businesses can reap from using GMB:

                GOOGLE MY BUSINESS:INCREASED VISIBILITY ONLINE
              </h2>
              <p>
                When someone searches for your business on Google, your GMB listing will appear as one of the top results, giving them an easy way to learn more about what you offer and how to get in touch. If you’re a local business, this is a significant way to encourage foot traffic through your door.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your GMB listing includes your business hours, contact information, and location on a map, making it easy for potential customers to find you and get in touch. And if you have a website, you can link to it from your GMB listing, giving customers another way to learn more about your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Google My Business is a free tool that allows businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including Search and Maps. Claiming and verifying your GMB listing is simple and only takes a few minutes. Once you’ve claimed your listing, you can start adding photos, responding to reviews, and adding updates to show up in search results. You can also use Google My Business to monitor your performance on Google and make sure your listing is accurate and up-to-date.

              </h2>
              <p>
                GMB listings include basic information like your phone number, website URL, and hours of operation. This makes it easy for potential customers to get in touch with you. Customers can also use your listing to get directions if you have a brick-and-mortar location.
              </p>
              <p>
                Including as much detail as possible in your GMB listing helps potential customers learn more about your business and what you have to offer. You can also add photos, videos, and posts to give visitors a better sense of your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suppose you want to attract even more attention to your GMB listing. In that case, you can try using Google My Business features like “Questions & Answers” and “Posts.” These features let you interact directly with potential customers, answer their questions, and give them more information about your business.

            <p>
              GMB provides valuable insights into how customers find and interact with your business online. This information can help you make better marketing decisions in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              GMB also allows you to track how many people have viewed your business listing, called impressions. Impressions are the number of times your listing has been seen on Google, whether customers clicked through to your website or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can see how many people have requested directions to your business, called direction requests. Direction requests are the number of times customers have asked for recommendations to your business from their current location using Google Maps.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a physical store, you can see how many people have visited that location, called store visits. Store visits are the number of times someone went to your physical store after searching for your business on Google.

              </p>
              <p>
